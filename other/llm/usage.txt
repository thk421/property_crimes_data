why does this code return an error? 

property_crime_data <- cleaned_crimes_data %>%
  filter(crime == "Home Invasion", "Property Theft")
  
ChatGPT

The error in your code is due to the way you're using the filter() function with multiple conditions. In R, when you want to filter for multiple values in a column, you need to use the %in% operator. Here’s how you can correct your code:

property_crime_data <- cleaned_crimes_data %>%
  filter(crime %in% c("Home Invasion", "Property Theft"))

Take in mind that I have a dataset with the variable REPORT_YEAR which includes the year of the report (between 2014 and 2023) across the 16 divisions in Toronto listed in the DIVISION variable (consisting of "D11", "D12", "D13", "D14", "D22", "D23", "D31", "D32", "D33", "D41", "D42", "D43", "D51", "D52", "D53", "D55"). The CATEGORY variable divides the reports into either ‘Crimes Against Person’ and ‘Crimes Against Property’, with the SUBTYPE variable to name the specific crimes committed. This dataset also includes the variable COUNT_ to indicate the total number of crime reports, and the variable COUNT_CLEARED for the number of reports cleared. Take note that the reports are not distinct occurences, meaning there can be multiple reports for the same crime, as well as an occurrence of one crime with multiple offence types.

How would I write code in r to find out the division which had the most significant change in property crime trends before and after the onset of covid in the year 2020?

ChatGPT
To find the division with the most significant change in property crime trends before and after the onset of COVID-19 (2020), you can break down the process in R into these steps:

1. Filter Data: Focus on the 'Crimes Against Property' in the CATEGORY column and the specific years before and after 2020.
2. Group Data: Group by division and compute crime rates for the period before (2014-2019) and after (2020-2023).
3. Compute the Change: Calculate the percentage or absolute change in crime rates for each division.
4. Identify the Division with the Largest Change.

Here’s a sample code in R to do this:

# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming your data frame is named 'crime_data'
# Step 1: Filter data for 'Crimes Against Property' and the relevant subtypes
property_crime_data <- crime_data %>%
  filter(CATEGORY == 'Crimes Against Property', 
         SUBTYPE %in% c('theft', 'home invasion'))

# Step 2: Create a pre-COVID (2014-2019) and post-COVID (2020-2023) indicator
property_crime_data <- property_crime_data %>%
  mutate(PERIOD = ifelse(REPORT_YEAR < 2020, 'Pre-COVID', 'Post-COVID'))

# Step 3: Group data by DIVISION and PERIOD and calculate total crimes per period
crime_trends <- property_crime_data %>%
  group_by(DIVISION, PERIOD) %>%
  summarise(Total_Crimes = sum(COUNT_)) %>%
  spread(PERIOD, Total_Crimes, fill = 0)

# Step 4: Calculate the percentage change in crimes between pre-COVID and post-COVID
crime_trends <- crime_trends %>%
  mutate(Change = (Post-COVID - Pre-COVID) / Pre-COVID * 100)

# Step 5: Find the division with the largest percentage change
division_most_change <- crime_trends %>%
  filter(!is.na(Change)) %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(Change))) %>%
  slice(1)

# View the result
print(division_most_change)

# Optionally: Visualize the change across divisions
ggplot(crime_trends, aes(x = reorder(DIVISION, Change), y = Change)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Percentage Change in Property Crime Pre- and Post-COVID",
       x = "Division", y = "Percentage Change") +
  theme_minimal()

Why am I seeing this error?

summarise() has grouped output by 'division'. You can override using the.groups argument.

ChatGPT
The message you’re seeing is a common warning from dplyr’s summarise() function. By default, summarise() keeps the groups in the output (in this case, by division), but it also lets you know that you can control this behavior using the .groups argument.

You can suppress this message and control the grouping in the output by explicitly setting the .groups argument. Here are your options:

If you want to ungroup the data after summarization:
You can set .groups = "drop" to ungroup the data after summarise(). This is often what you want when summarizing data.

If you want to retain the grouping:
If you want to keep the grouping by division, you can use .groups = "keep":

If you want to remove only the last group:
You can use .groups = "drop_last", which will keep the grouping by division but drop the grouping by covid_period.

how do I change this code so that the crime report counts are displayed by numbers in thousands instead of the expression e


crime_counts_per_year <- cleaned_crimes_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(total_crime_count = sum(count))

ggplot(crime_counts_per_year, aes(x = factor(year), y = total_crime_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  labs(title = "Yearly Toronto Crime Reports",
       x = "Report Year",
       y = "Number of Reports") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5) 
  )
  
ChatGPT
To display the crime report counts in thousands instead of using scientific notation (e.g., 1e+05), you can modify the y-axis labels using the scale_y_continuous() function in ggplot2. Specifically, you can set the labels to be formatted as numbers divided by 1,000 and include a "k" suffix to indicate thousands.

Here's how to adjust your code:
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

crime_counts_per_year <- cleaned_crimes_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(total_crime_count = sum(count))

ggplot(crime_counts_per_year, aes(x = factor(year), y = total_crime_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  labs(title = "Yearly Toronto Crime Reports",
       x = "Report Year",
       y = "Number of Reports (in thousands)") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format(scale = 1e-3, suffix = "k")) +  # Change y-axis labels
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
  )

Explanation:
scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format(scale = 1e-3, suffix = "k")):

scale = 1e-3: This divides the y-values by 1,000, effectively converting counts to thousands.
suffix = "k": This appends a "k" to the labels, indicating that the numbers are in thousands.
scales package: Make sure to load the scales package, which is typically included with the ggplot2 library, but you can explicitly install it with install.packages("scales") if necessary.

This adjustment will format your y-axis labels to show numbers in thousands, enhancing readability for your plot!

Why is my clearance rate a straight line?

ChatGPT
If your clearance rate appears as a straight line in the graph, there are several possible explanations for this phenomenon. Here are some common reasons:

1. Constant Clearance Rate:
Lack of Variation: If the clearance rate is calculated as a simple proportion (cleared crimes divided by total crimes) and the values for cleared crimes and total crimes have remained relatively constant over the years, the clearance rate will also remain constant. This means there’s been no significant change in the effectiveness of solving crimes over the observed period.
2. Data Aggregation:
Limited Data Points: If your dataset aggregates data in a way that masks variations (for example, averaging or summing values across multiple years), it may produce a flat clearance rate line.
Rounding Issues: If the numbers involved in calculating the clearance rate are rounded or if there are only a few incidents that affect the calculation, you might see a flat line instead of a fluctuating one.
3. Calculation Errors:
Improper Calculation: Ensure that the clearance rate is being calculated correctly. The formula for the clearance rate is:
Clearance Rate
=
(
COUNT_CLEARED
COUNT_
)
×
100
Clearance Rate=( 
COUNT_
COUNT_CLEARED
​
 )×100
If COUNT_CLEARED is not changing significantly compared to COUNT_, or if you mistakenly reference a constant value in your calculations, the clearance rate will appear straight.
4. Lack of Crime Variation:
Stable Crime Rates: If the total number of crimes reported remains stable over the years and the number cleared is consistent, the clearance rate will show no significant changes, resulting in a straight line.
5. Limited Time Period:
Short Time Frame: If you’re only analyzing a short time frame with limited data, it might not provide enough variability to show trends. For example, if the data covers only two or three years with similar values, the graph may not reflect any changes.
Suggestions to Investigate Further:
Check the Data: Review your dataset for COUNT_ and COUNT_CLEARED to ensure there is sufficient variation across the years. Look for any years with zero reports or significant missing values.

Examine the Calculation: Verify the calculation of the clearance rate to ensure you are correctly summing and dividing the appropriate values for each year.

Plot Raw Data: Consider plotting the raw counts of COUNT_ and COUNT_CLEARED separately to see if they show variability. This might help you identify if the issue lies in the calculations or if the actual data is stable.

Look for Changes in Law Enforcement Practices: If the data is correct and the clearance rate remains constant, consider external factors that might contribute to a stable clearance rate, such as consistent law enforcement practices or policies over the years.

Example Check in R:
You can check the counts for each year to see if there's any variation:

r
코드 복사
# Check counts of cleared and total crimes per year
crime_summary <- crime_data %>%
  group_by(REPORT_YEAR) %>%
  summarise(Total_Crimes = sum(COUNT_), 
            Cleared_Crimes = sum(COUNT_CLEARED, na.rm = TRUE))

print(crime_summary)
This output can give you insight into whether there are any significant changes in the underlying data that would affect the clearance rate.

could it be because the number of crimes is really big and the clearance rate number is small so the graph needs to be adjusted?

ChatGPT

Yes, that's a very plausible explanation for why the clearance rate might appear as a straight line on your graph! Here are a few factors to consider regarding scale and visualization:

### 1. **Scale of Values**:
- **Disparity in Magnitude**: If the total number of crimes (`COUNT_`) is significantly larger than the number of cleared crimes (`COUNT_CLEARED`), the resulting clearance rate (which is typically a percentage) could be a relatively small value. When plotted on the same graph as the total crime counts (which are much larger), the clearance rate line may appear very flat and straight because it’s dwarfed by the larger scale of total crimes.

### 2. **Axis Limits**:
- **Y-Axis Range**: If the Y-axis of your plot is not appropriately scaled to accommodate both total crime counts and clearance rates, the clearance rate could be compressed into a small visual range, making it look like a straight line. 

### 3. **Using Different Axes**:
- **Dual Axes**: To better visualize the relationship between total crimes and clearance rates, consider using dual y-axes. This allows you to plot the total crime counts on one axis and the clearance rate on another, making it easier to see trends without one line obscuring the other.

### Example of Using Dual Axes in ggplot:
Here's how you could implement a dual-axis plot in ggplot2:

```r
library(ggplot2)

# Create the plot
ggplot(crime_trends, aes(x = REPORT_YEAR)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Total_Crimes, color = "Total Crimes"), size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Clearance_Rate * 1000, color = "Clearance Rate (scaled)"), size = 1) +  # Scale the clearance rate for visibility
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~./1000, name = "Clearance Rate (%)")) +  # Secondary axis for clearance rate
  labs(title = "Total Crimes vs Clearance Rate Over Time",
       x = "Year", y = "Count") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Total Crimes" = "cornflowerblue", "Clearance Rate (scaled)" = "coral")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Adjustments in the Code:
- **Scaling the Clearance Rate**: Here, the clearance rate is multiplied by 1000 to help it visualize more prominently against the total crime counts. You can adjust this factor based on the range of values you see.
- **Secondary Axis**: The `sec_axis` function adds a secondary y-axis to the plot for the clearance rate, making it easier to interpret alongside total crimes.

### Conclusion:
Adjusting your graph's scale can significantly enhance clarity and allow you to better observe relationships between variables. If your clearance rate remains small compared to total crime counts, dual axes or alternative scaling can provide a clearer picture of the data trends.
